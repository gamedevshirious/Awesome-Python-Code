An XOR linked list is a more memory efficient doubly linked list. Instead of each node holdingnext and prev fields, it holds a field namedboth, which is an XOR of the next node and the previous node. Implement an XOR linked list; it has anadd(element) which adds the element to the end, and a get(index)which returns the node at index.

If using a language that has no pointers (such as Python), you can assume you have access toget_pointer anddereference_pointerfunctions that converts between nodes and memory addresses.
